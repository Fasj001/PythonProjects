# PythonProjects
Here is some simple python projects im doing

Project 1:
This is a simple login page with a simple quiz that has some random questions in it, while i have the code for the calculator i cannot get it to work. So that part is a work in progress for now. The main point of this project is to build up on my already existing Python work asginment so some of the code is relatively similar.
